I'm an 🇮🇹 Italian guy in my twenties, passionate about computer science and tech stuff. I always try to come up with some stupid idea of 
someting to build just to keep me from getting bored. And when I'm not doing that is probably because I'm out there learning something new.
Right now I'm pretty busy working at Storm Reply.

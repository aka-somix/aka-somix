I'm an Italian guy 🇮🇹 in my twenties, passionate about computer science. I always try to come up with some stupid idea of 
someting to build just to keep me from getting bored. And when I'm not doing that is probably because I'm out there learning something new.
Right now I'm pretty busy working for Storm Reply though.
I obtained a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering in 2020.
Ah yes, I'm also a Guitarist in my free time. 


## 👨‍💻 What I am up lately 

- AWS Architecting and Developing @StormReply
- Data analytics with Python
- API development with JS/TS

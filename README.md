Welcome to Somix's Page 🐳

Hi, I'm Salvatore Cirone, also known on the internet as *Somix*.

### About me 👤
I'm an Italian guy, in my twenties, passionate about computer science, but really with everything that tech related.  
I earned a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Engineering in 2020. In this period I'm constantly searching for some new cool stuff to learn.  
Ah yes, I'm also a Guitarist with core knowledge of music theory.

### Technologies that I enjoy to use 👨‍💻
- Python (a lot)
- Java (and the Spring Framework)
- Javascript (Vue.js and Node.js)

And I really want to learn Ruby on Rails in the near future!
